# Counting Sheep
Draw sheep on paper and watch their gruesome faith unfold.

### Introduction
Counting Sheep is a solo drawing game where you try to save as many sheep as possible from disasters. While you can tally a score of remaining sheep; the real takeaway from the game is the weird little stories that unfold like when sheeps are engulfed in lava or get revenge on the wolf that ate their friend. These stories are documented in your drawings and will bring a silly smile to your face everytime you look at them.

### What do I do?
The focus of the game is to roll a dice and place sheep, trees and other objects on a 6 by 6 grid. 

- The game is over when the grid is filled. 

- The number of remaining sheep is your score.

1. Make a six by six grid on the paper.
2. Place your eraser north of the grid.

The cabin protects the sheep from wolf attacks.

## Resolving disasters
Trouble always comes from a specific direction. When the game starts,the direction is north. After resolving trouble, the direction shifts in a clockwise manner to east - south - west - north etc. tip: Place your eraser as a marker of the current direction to keep track.

### Wolf
The wolf attacks from the woods. (If no sheep are next to trees skip this disaster.) 

- The wolf will eat a sheep next to a tree in the current direction.
> Erase the sheep and replace it with a wolf.


### Flood
The flood always flood all existing water cells with one in the current direction. (If there is no water on the grid skip this disaster.) 

- The flood will destroy sheep, cabin, tree and wolf.
- The flood can not move over mountains.
- The flood will put out a fire but not flood the cell. (Creating a free space.)

> Draw water on flooded cells.

### Fire
The fire starts at the first burnable object in the current direction. (If there are no burnable objects on the first row skip this disaster.)

- The fire will spread from the first burnable object to all adjecent burnable objects.

> Draw fire on all affected cells.

### Storm
The storm only affects fire. (If there is no fire skip this disaster.)
Roll the die to decide storm strength. 

Strength 1-3
The gentle storm puts out all fires on the grid.

Strength 4-6
The storm operates like the flood but for fire. 

-The storm will spread fire once cell from each fire in the current direction.

> Draw fire on affected cells.

### Lightning
The lightning strikes at one point. Roll the die twice to find the x and y position.

- The lightning strike causes a fire.
- Unless it strikes in water, then it evaporate the water in that cell.
- If it hits a mountain a **volcano** is created. (Roll die again to determine lava(fire) spread.
