# Counting Sheep
Draw sheep on paper and watch their gruesome faith unfold.

### Introduction
Counting Sheep is a solo drawing game where you try to save as many sheep as possible from disasters. While you can tally a score of remaining sheep; the real takeaway from the game is the weird little stories that unfold like when sheeps are engulfed in lava or get revenge on the wolf that ate their friend. These stories are documented in your drawings and will bring a silly smile to your face everytime you look at them.

### What do I do?
The focus of the game is to roll a dice and place sheep, trees and other objects on a 6 by 6 grid. 

- The game is over when the grid is filled. 

- The number of remaining sheep is your score.
